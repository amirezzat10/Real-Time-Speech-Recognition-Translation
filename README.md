# Real-Time-Speech-Recognition-Translation

This project is a DEPI graduation project that aims to build a real-time speech recognition and translation system using Python. It uses OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text and MarianMT for language translation, with audio preprocessing done via Librosa and Torchaudio. The system is designed to support multiple languages and is planned to be deployed on Microsoft Azure using Azure Speech Services and Azure ML. The project is still under active development.
